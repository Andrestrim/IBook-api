# IBook-api
This project is part of my learning journey, where I explore how to connect a front-end application to an API and manipulate the data. Since my focus is to learn how API integrations work, the front-end and the back-end are simple. The repository will include the  API and I will create one to the front-end separately and link it in the readme.
